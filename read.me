This code is from Thinking in Java 4th Edition authored by Bruce Eckel
The code was to include a package called util from mindview etc.
Instead, a util jar file was created based on the com.juanpickselov.util package
and the Print calls are being made to the jar file added to this project
The jar file was created using the Project Structure artifact abd build artifacts option in IntelliJ IDEA
